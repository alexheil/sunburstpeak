            <p>- Bolded labels to make them way more visible.</p>
            <p>- Added space between labels and text because they were too on top of each other prior.</p>

            <p>- Fixed an issue with font size on the home page on mobile browsers because the text had been hiding offscreen.</p>
            <p>- Space between paragraphs made larger as they were too smooshed together.</p>
            <p>- Added Google Analytics because I forgot to before beta launch. Oops!</p>
            <p>- Put date on share cards so you don't even have to visit the site to see when an event is.</p>
